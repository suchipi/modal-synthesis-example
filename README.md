# modal-synthesis-example

This code uses the Web Audio API to create a synthesizer for a modal sound. It's set to the values from a recording of me hitting a glass on my desk with my apple pencil, but it has controls to adjust the values using global multipliers. The code is also written in such a way that the values themselves are separated from everything else, so you could replace them with different values (from your own recording of a modal sound), if you like.
